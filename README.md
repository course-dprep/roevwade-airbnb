## Research motivation 
Roe v Wade is an important case that legalized abortion in the US and created national controversy by dividing the country into two. With this lawsuit, abortion was legalized in all states of the USA because it was a constitutional right for women. However, after this decision, the conservative-leaning court made it easier for states to make their own decisions, and it was outlawed again in some states. The impact of such a resounding lawsuit was not limited to national politics but had effects in many areas such as financial, social, health and tourism. 

This research will explore and analyze how Roe v Wade impacted the Airbnb market within different states. It will be studied whether there is a correlation between the variables such as prices and reviews of hosts between states where abortion is legal and not. The latest data Airbnb offers will be used.  It will be interesting to examine the effects of the lawsuit on Airbnb, which is not operating in an area first to come to mind in the abortion debate.
